    <!--Information about the Main heading-->
    <p>Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery is a conservation project that was established in 1981 by the Sri Lanka Wildlife Conservation Society. It is located in the town of Kosgoda, on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka. The hatchery is dedicated to the conservation of sea turtles, which are an endangered species due to habitat destruction, poaching, and accidental capture in fishing nets. The hatchery is responsible for collecting sea turtle eggs from nearby beaches and providing a safe place for them to hatch. The eggs are kept in a protected area where they can incubate safely until they hatch. Once the hatchlings emerge from their shells, they are kept in tanks until they are strong enough to be released into the ocean. Visitors to the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery can observe the various stages of the hatching process, from the collection of the eggs to the release of the hatchlings into the ocean. The hatchery has a variety of tanks where visitors can observe adult sea turtles. The tanks are divided into sections based on the species of sea turtle and their age. Visitors can learn about the different species of sea turtles that are found in Sri Lanka, including the green turtle, hawksbill turtle, loggerhead turtle, olive ridley turtle, and leatherback turtle.</p>
