    <p>The Bentota Turtle Hatchery is a conservation project that was established in 1986 by the Sri Lanka Turtle Conservation Project. It is located on the west coast of Sri Lanka, in the town of Bentota. The hatchery is dedicated to the conservation of sea turtles, which are an endangered species due to habitat destruction, poaching, and accidental capture in fishing nets. The hatchery collects sea turtle eggs from nearby beaches and provides a safe place for them to hatch. Once the hatchlings emerge from their shells, they are kept in tanks until they are strong enough to be released into the ocean. Visitors to the Bentota Turtle Hatchery can observe the various stages of the hatching process, from the collection of the eggs to the release of the hatchlings into the ocean. The hatchery has a variety of tanks where visitors can observe adult sea turtles. The tanks are divided into sections based on the species of sea turtle and their age. Visitors can learn about the different species of sea turtles that are found in Sri Lanka, including the green turtle, hawksbill turtle, loggerhead turtle, olive ridley turtle, and leatherback turtle.</p>
